  goal_evaluation_prompt: |
    Evaluate if the billing dispute has been truly resolved. Look for:
    
    ACHIEVED indicators:
    ✅ Confirmed refund processed or account credited
    ✅ Ticket resolution with reference number
    ✅ Billing correction acknowledged and completed
    ✅ Customer satisfaction confirmed
    
    NOT ACHIEVED indicators:
    ❌ "I'll look into the refund" (promise, not completion)
    ❌ "A ticket has been created" (process started, not resolved)
    ❌ "The issue should be resolved soon" (future promise)
    ❌ "Let me transfer you for the refund" (escalation, not resolution)
    
    Examples of false positives to avoid:
    ❌ "I'll make sure this is resolved" ≠ actual resolution
    ❌ "Your refund will be processed" ≠ refund completed
    ❌ "I've created a ticket for this issue" ≠ issue resolved
